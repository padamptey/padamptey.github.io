 

Survey of Data Governance Policies, processing concerns and purging of fortune hundred (100) companies for the year 2022.


RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

This research seeks to explore where law and technology meet. The first step is to identify the global fortune hundred (100) companies for the year ending 2022 and compile their geographical dispersion. The focus is to establish processing concerns in the governance policies and then use the appropriate programing language to purge or develop rules, triggers and algorithms to solve such issues. This is to help technology experts and non-technology experts such as legal practitioners, management etc. to formulate and implement governance policies with ease and clarity. This will also eliminate all ambiguities in the governance policies for corporate bodies.# padamptey.github.io

Week 2 journal

I met with my supervisor to discuss the research topic and schedules. We also discussed research interests and aims of the research. I research into researched the global fortune 100 companies for 2022 and their geographical dispersion. I was able to gather further existing literature on these organizations. It was interesting to note how the same companies keep swapping positions in the rankings.

Week 3 journal

I started my research with a survey the governance policies of the first fifteen (15) fortune hundred (100) for the year ending 2022 to observe and isolate processing concerns found.  The idea is to harvest enough data for the second stage of the research. We shall have the opportunity to discuss possible solutions or triggers or rules that can be developed to purge them. I also submitted the report for M1 in the dream research schedule.

Week 4 journal

Survey the governance policies of the second badge of fifteen (16-30) fortune hundred for the year ending 2022 to observe and isolate processing concerns found. Discuss posing solution or triggers or rules that can be developed to purge them. I met my mentor for the second time to discuss my progress report and the way forward. he was helpful to solve my concerns

Week 5 journal

I surveyed the governance policies of the third badge of fifteen (31-45) fortune hundred for the year ending 2022 to observe and isolate processing concerns found. Discuss posing solution or triggers or rules that can be developed to purge them. I met my advisor the second time in a meeting to discuss our progress report. All concerns were addressed. I completed the M2 of the dream schedule.

Week 6 Journal

Surveyed the governance policies of the third badge of fifteen (46-60) fortune hundred for the year ending 2022 to observe and isolate processing concerns found. Discussed possible solutions or triggers or rules that can be developed to purge them.

Week 7 journal

This is the week where I surveyed the governance policies of the fourth badge of fifteen (61-75) fortune hundred for the year ending 2022 to observe and isolate processing concerns found.  Some of these big companies are found in different geographical location so it was not surprising to different privacy storage procedures for these regions. Discuss possible solutions or triggers or rules that can be developed to purge them.

Week 8 journal

 I surveyed the governance policies of the fifth badge of fifteen (76-90) fortune hundred for the year ending 2022 to observe and isolate processing concerns found. We discussed possible solutions or triggers or rules that can be developed to purge them. I had the opportunity to submit my progress report for the research to trigger M3.
